- ✔ Start your json-server with json-server --watch db/db.json -p 4000
- ✔ The templates folder has a template for each page you have to build
- ✔ There's a folder with screenshots of each page you have to build
- ✔ The app should have 3 main routes: products, categories, basket
- ✔ When a user lands on the app, they should be redirected to the products route
- ✔ Make sure you have dynamic routes for the products detail page once a user clicks on a product card
- Inside the Categories, each category should lead to a filtered version of the products page
- The add to basket button on the Products Details page should add the item to the basket, and take you to the basket page 

Tips
- With routes, your URL bar becomes part of your state! Use it to your advantage, by setting up your routes with dynamic parameters

Challenge
- Create a "404 not found" page that should appear every time that a route doesn't match
- Implement a search bar that on submits should take you to a products page with the results of the search


TODO:
1. Ask about updating the basket quantity immutably
2. Loading Part
